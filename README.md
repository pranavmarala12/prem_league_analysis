From there, I decided to take a list of the best goal scorers and see how efficent they were - I took total goals per player and compared that to total minutes played. I decided to use the below formula as my basis for determining efficiency:

Total minutes / Total goals = goals per minute (efficiency) 

Lastly, I took the top 10 of the top 20 goal scorers and compared (side by side) a players actual goals with their expected goals (See expected_goals.png)

first - top 20

second - efficiency 

third - expected goals

Overall analysis confirmed what I had expected in terms of the best players in the premier league last season but ......
