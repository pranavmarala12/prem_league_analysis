Early on, I pulled a list of each column title in the dataset so I could get an early view of which statsitics would be of value to me in this project. For this step of the project I used the 'Gls' column as the driving metric for my ranking. I created a bar chart with the final rankings (Top 20 Goal Scorers.png).

From there, I wanted to take that ranking and see which players were the most efficient at scoring goals. Using 'Min' and 'Gls' I used the below formula to determine efficiency:

Total minutes / Total goals = goals per minute (efficiency)

I wanted to compare actual goals scored with the expected goals to figure out - whuch player capitalized on their chances? 


I went into this project with a rough idea of what the outcomes would look like but I wanted to challenge myself to use Python to confirm my...
