# dataset: "premier-player-23-24"

I first ranked and graphed the top 20 goal scorers from the 23/24 Premier League season to get a better visual as to who was netting the highest volume of goals. As an avid fan of the Premier League this ranking came as no surprise - this was a easy way to get familiar with my data set. Early on, I pulled a list of each column title in the dataset so I could get an early view of which statsitics would be of value to me in this project. For this step of the project I used the 'Gls' column as the driving metric for my ranking. I created a bar chart with the final rankings (Top 20 Goal Scorers.png).

From there, I wanted to take that ranking and see which players were the most efficient at scoring goals. Using 'Min' and 'Gls' I used the below formula to determine efficiency:
Total minutes / Total goals = goals per minute (efficiency) 
What I found interesting about this part of the project was that the data very closely followed the pattern from the first part of the project.

Lastly, I took the top 10 of the top 20 goal scorers and did a side by side comparison of a players actual goal count with their respective expected goals (expected_goals.png). Expected Goals (xG) is a soccer specific statistic that takes things such as positioning, speed, and even player footing into consideration that equals xG. I wanted to compare actual goals scored with their xG to figure out whuch player capitalized on their scoring chances the most. 

I went into this project with a rough idea of what the outcomes for each section would look like but I wanted to challenge myself to use Python to confirm. This was a rewarding exercise that allowed me to go deeper into the statistics behind the Premier League.
