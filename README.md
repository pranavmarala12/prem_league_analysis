I was able to pull a list of each column title in the dataset making me fully aware of which columns were going to be of value.


From there, I decided to take a list of the best goal scorers and see how efficent they were - I took total goals per player and compared that to total minutes played. I used the below formula as my basis for determining efficiency:
